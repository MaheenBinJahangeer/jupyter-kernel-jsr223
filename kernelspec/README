The kernel.json file in this directory is a template for Jupyter kernel specs
set up according to

    http://jupyter-client.readthedocs.org/en/latest/kernels.html#kernel-specs

In order to have a valid kernel spec you need to replace the sigilled $VARIABLEs
with appropriate values.

An example of a kernel spec for Jython with paths from my own development machine is


    {
     "argv": ["java",
              "-classpath",
                  "/opt/jython2.7.0/jython.jar:/home/kay/NetBeansProjects/jupyter-kernel/dist/jupyter-kernel.jar",
              "org.jupyterkernel.kernel.Session",
                  "-k", "python",
                  "-f", "{connection_file}"],
     "display_name": "Jython 2.7",
     "language": "python"
    }

Note that the special {connection_file} is a Jupyter variable which is filled by Jupyter when it calls
the kernel. No need to touch it.
