README
=======

The kernel.json file in this directory is a template for Jupyter kernel specs
set up according to

    http://jupyter-client.readthedocs.org/en/latest/kernels.html#kernel-specs

In order to have a valid kernel spec you need to replace the sigilled $VARIABLEs
with appropriate values.

Jython example

An example of a kernel spec for Jython with paths from my own development machine is


    {
     "argv": ["java",
              "-classpath",
<<<<<<< HEAD
                  "/opt/jython2.7.0/jython.jar:/opt/jupyter-kernel-jsr223/jupyter-kernel-jsr223.jar",
=======
                  "/opt/jython2.7.0/jython.jar:/home/kay/NetBeansProjects/jupyter-kernel/dist/jupyter-kernel.jar",
>>>>>>> c188ebc12b4221da498b5d883d270342fb771138
              "org.jupyterkernel.kernel.Session",
                  "-k", "python",
                  "-f", "{connection_file}"],
     "display_name": "Jython 2.7",
     "language": "python"
    }

Note that the special {connection_file} is a Jupyter variable which is filled by Jupyter when it calls
the kernel. No need to touch it.

Clojure example
---------------

Unlike Jython, Clojure 1.8.0 doesn't support jsr223 out of the box. Instead one needs a 3rd party implementation.

I can recommend the following one

    https://github.com/ato/clojure-jsr223

which I used for debugging. Unlike another implementation by the same author it properly supports customization
of Stdout.

Note that both the clojure-xxx.jar as well as the clojure-jsr223-xxx.jar have to be added to the classpath:

    {
     "argv": ["java",
              "-classpath",
                  "/opt/clojure-1.8.0/clojure-jsr223-1.8.0.jar:/opt/clojure-1.8.0/clojure-1.8.0.jar:/opt/jupyter-kernel-jsr223/jupyter-kernel-jsr223.jar",
              "org.jupyterkernel.kernel.Session",
                  "-k", "clojure",
                  "-f", "{connection_file}"],
     "display_name": "Clojure 1.8",
     "language": "clojure"
    }
